###Music listening habits and political activities
What does the music we listen to say about our political activities? An emerging body of research suggests that our lifestyle habits are intimately connected with our political views in surprising ways. One area that has remained largely unexplored is how musical activity correlates with political activity—both party alignment and protest behavior. For example, can we predict voting behavior from musical taste? Is there a “musical signature” before or after political protest, such as the events currently unfolding in France?

We seek to address questions such as these using data from Last.fm, a site where users may “scrobble” their musical activity to a web profile. Users can input data from a variety of platforms, including Spotify, and they can develop social connections on Last.fm. Using the Last.fm API, we plan to collect data over a period of time to look at longitudinal trends in music listening.
